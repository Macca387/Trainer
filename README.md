# Trainer

This repo is a fork of the little "Trainer" app developed as a tool to help students get comfortable performing random combinations, which was initially created by Dan Samuelsson

# Use

The app is just HTML, JavaScript and some Audio files stored in a media subfolder. It will run on most browsers but stick to something Chromium based like Chrome, Edge, Opera etc. Others should be fine

# Installation

Just copy the files somewhere (don't forget the audio subfolder) and open the html file.

If you've a git person, use the below

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/Macca387/Trainer
```

# Dependencies

JavaScript is pretty plain but see the browsers mentioned above

# My changes

I am changing this from the original to make it more of an overall at home karate training assistant. As a student of Sensei Daniel Samuelsson I am working in conjunction with him to create this. There will be embeded videos of Sensei Dan performing kata for your visual reference.
